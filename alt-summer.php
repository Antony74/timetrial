<br>
<p>Out of the main gate, run down the road towards Wallingford.  Turn left at the roundabout,
cross the road at the Hungry Horse and run down the Old Reading Road (by the school, as per the
Winter course).  At the end of the road, instead of turning left, turn right and run along the track
to the farm.  Go through the farm gates and immediately turn right, run into the field and turn left
towards the river (perpendicular to the river, along one of the pre-defined tracks, no cutting the corner!).
Run along the river back to Wallingford, run under the road bridge and you come out by the open-air swimming
pool.  Turn right and run by the carpark and up to the main road.  Run along the main road until you get to
 the footpath just before the church, turn left down the footpath.  At the end of the footpath, go
 through the gate and turn right onto the footpath which leads onto the road home.  The finish is at the MAIN gate.
Distance 5.2 km.</p>
