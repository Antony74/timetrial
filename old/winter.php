<p>From the HR main gate, head down the road towards Wallingford.
At the mini-roundabout, turn left, cross the main road and take the right turn exactly
opposite the Hungry Horse.  This road goes past a school and is very quiet.  At the end of the
road turn left and cross the A4074.  Directly opposite is an earth track, follow this uphill.
At the end of the track, turn left onto a tarmac road and run back downhill to the A4074.
Cross the road and take the path directly opposite.  This path leads onto a close coming out
on the road into Wallingford.  Run back to the mini-roundabout, take a right and head back to HR.
The finish is the side gate.</p>
